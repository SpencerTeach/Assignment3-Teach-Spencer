              <h3>Patriots Vs. Dolphins 12/20</h3>
              <p>This week is a divisional matchup vs the Miami Dolphins in Miami. While the Patriots usually struggle in South Beach, this is a new team and entierly different situation. This is do or die to continue hopes for the playoffs and Cam Newton has to be ready from the start to beat up on the Dolphins. With young rookie Tua starting for the Dolphins, it will be his opportunity to get past the pesky Patriots that have so often been the bully for the Dolphins. Going off the season, I do expect a slow start, with the Dolphins mainting a small lead up through the half. My hope is that the second half will be a success for the Patriots, with the run game working and a quick touchdown to start the 3rd. With the momentum, I believe the Patriots will win 24-17 on the back of two Cam rushing TD's and the defense holding strong. As always, Go Pats, LFG.</p>
