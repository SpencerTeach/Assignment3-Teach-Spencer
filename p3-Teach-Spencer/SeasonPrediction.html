      <h2> Patriots Season Outlook</h2>
      <p> From the offseason COVID-19 sit outs,the departure of Brady and Gronk, and the incoming youth led to a very questionable season that loomed. While the Patriots started strong, a combination of more cases of COVID and slow performances led to a rocky season. While there is still hope for a potential wild card spot, they must go through their division to get there, while having extreme luck on the part of other teams. These last 3 weeks are make or break it and it starts Sunday afternoon vs the Dolphins.</p>
